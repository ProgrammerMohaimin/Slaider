              <p>You've had a great period, shipping several impactful things. Yet, on the review, none of this is mentioned, only small, sideline things. How is it that they did not call out the big items? And since they never mentioned them, do they even know what you've worked on?</p>

              <p>On the meeting, you're excited: finally, a manager who doesn't keep you waiting, and gives you what you're waiting for: the bonus and pay numbers, then ask you if you have any questions. You are still thinking about how to spend that money - so you probably won't have questions?</p>

              <p>After the meeting, you re-evaluate if this is the review you really wanted. It was called a performance review, except you did not talk about one thing: your performance. And the next day you might feel too awkward to bring this up. This type of review is no better than the "zero specifics" review.</p>

              <p>The kind of review, after which you walk out, with your blood boiling. During the review, you get some negative feedback, which your manager tries to deliver in a civilized way. So they accompany it with examples. Except those examples are one-sided, miss key details and are mis-interpreted. </p>

              <p> I'm not talking about the positively biased, but the negatively biased ones. There could be a recency bias, focusing on a near-term hick-up, but ignoring lots of great work from before. There could be gender bias, especially if you're female, with more focus on your behaviour than your accomplishments,</p>

              <p>I left the most important one for last. If a review takes you completely by surprise - usually not in a good way, that's a fail on your manager delivering feedback on a continuous basis. Good reviews will bring lots of new information, but very little surprises. Period.</p>
